        <p>This is a classic trading game. You start with some money. Buy a ship. Buy some cargo. Sail to another port. Sell
        the cargo at a profit. And repeat until rich</p>

        <p>Along the way, you can upgrade to bigger and faster ships so you can make money even faster.</p>

        <p>But you have to be quick. Your crew is eating your ships stores. When you are in port, that costs
            money. And if you just float around at sea, your stores can run out and you starve.
