        <h1>A Steampunk Traiding Game</h1>

        <p>This is a classic trading game. You start with some money. Buy a ship. Buy some cargo. Sail to another port. Sell
        the cargo at a profit. And repeat until rich</p>

        <p>Along the way, you can upgrade to bigger and faster ships so you can make money even faster.</p>

        <p>But you have to be quick. Your crew is eating up your supplies. When you are in port, that costs
            money. And at sea, you can starve.
