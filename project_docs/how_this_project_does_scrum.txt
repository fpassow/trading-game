HOW THIS PROJECT DOES SCRUM
---------------------------

The Scrum Master role equates to my general intention to do Scrum. It won't explicitly
appear unless I record a task to "remove an impediment to progress".

Backlog items can be added to project_tracking/backlog.txt at any time.


SPRINTS:

Sprints are one week, ending/starting first thing Saturday. Days are real days.

Because most "days" are so short (just my lunch break), reading and trying stuff will be
explicit backlog items. (I'm the product owner. And learning is something I want.)


THE  SPRINT REVIEW/RETROSPECTIVE/PLANNING EVENT (15 min, not including playing the game):
1. Play the game
2. Make a free-form entry into project_tracking/review_retro_log.txt
3. Update project_tracking/backlog.txt to reflect items complete in the sprint.
4. Move the old sprint_backlog.txt to project_tracking/archive/sprint_backlog_<n>.txt
5. Add backlog items to a new project_tracking/sprint_backlog.txt
6. Add detailed tasks to selected backlog items. Split items if needed.
7. Review the plan and remove items if needed until the sprint seems practical.


STANDUPS:

Standups are 5 minutes, max, at the beginning of each weekday lunch break or weekend programming time.

Detailed discussions (i.e. me thinking about technical details) are NOT allowed.

Update project_tracking/standup_log.txt with one or more COMP and PLAN lines.
  COMP: What did I complete yesterday that contributed to the team meeting our sprint goal?
  PLAN: What do I plan to complete today to contribute to the team meeting our sprint goal?
  [PED: Do I see any impediment that could prevent me or the team from meeting our sprint goal?]

If there's a PED, maybe make this a "PED Day" and remove something from sprint_backlog.txt.


COMPLETING A SPRINT EARLY:

If a sprint's items are all completed early, do the sprint ending and beginning stuff imediately.
They next sprint gets the remaining days, plus the full week that follows.
