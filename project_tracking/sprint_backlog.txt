"New cargos appear. Then make this look like a thing!"

--- New cargos appear
---   .5 Add "producers" to state
---  .5 Run them from the system clock

--- .5 Google CSS columns (Content flows from column to column. Very cool for text. But not what I need.)

--- .5 Make three panels with grid

- 2. Graphical map
    --- backgrounds for land and sea, ---And port

--- 1. Graphical ship

xxx Ship appears at new location with transition from old (just to see it. Loose on time.)
--- Once you select a square to move to, we switch to a "moving" state
---  In the moving state, the marks showing places you can move to go away
---  In the moving state, the boat is at your destination (WHICh IS RECORDED AS CURRENT LOCATION!!!!)
---  Your location updates at the start of the move
---  "moving" state resets at the end of the move
 --- Time area displays "Sailing..." and a countdown.
---  When a move starts, we also record the time it will end
---  Tick processing checks time and removes the moving state at the given time (then everything draws naturally)
--- Rock the boat while it's moving
--- Ignore new clicks to move while already moving

--- Fast time while at sea
 

--- Stop clock when showing intro screen

--- .5 Image for port
