Jan 17: Project is running. Added a few tiny features. Finished a couple days early.

Jan 26: Was often a bit burned out by the time my lunch time arrived. 
I pushed the end of the sprint to the middle of my Saturday study time. But then finished the sprint backlog.
Overall, the points see to be pretty accurate.

Feb 2: Redesigned state to be strictly one-level (with arrays), wrote a bunch of stateUtils, 
and wrote or updated a bunch of tests for all of the above.
I'm haven't finished multiple "See my..." UI items. But I now have much better utils for getting
the data which will be used by that kind of UI elements

Feb 9: Completed enough in-port stuff to be ready to set sail. Also made some map.
Things flowed well using the redesigned state and stateUtils. And I got a system clock
going and used it to drive food usage. Next sprint has a new feature branch "set sail".

Feb 16: I can sail between ports and buy and sell. Really wanting to make this look like
something soon.
Working on the stateUtils was a good fit for TDD. Other things, not so much. 

March 1: Dropping weekly sprints because spending a few days learning something else,
or a few days without free lunch hours, makes the plan for what to do that week completely invalid.
Keeping the idea of a sprint with a theme and goal.
This last "sprint" added UI elements for moving and seeing where I can move. Also, time
is really flowing and feels right. The next sprint "looking-better" will focus on replacing
place-holder visual elements with thing that actually look good.
