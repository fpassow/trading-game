Jan 17: Project is running. Added a few tiny features. Finished a couple days early.

Jan 26: Was often a bit burned out by the time my lunch time arrived. 
I pushed the end of the sprint to the middle of my Saturday study time. But then finished the sprint backlog.
Overall, the points see to be pretty accurate.
