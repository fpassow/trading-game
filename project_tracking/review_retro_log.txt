Jan 17: Project is running. Added a few tiny features. Finished a couple days early.

Jan 26: Was often a bit burned out by the time my lunch time arrived. 
I pushed the end of the sprint to the middle of my Saturday study time. But then finished the sprint backlog.
Overall, the points see to be pretty accurate.

Feb 2: Redesigned state to be strictly one-level (with arrays), wrote a bunch of stateUtils, 
and wrote or updated a bunch of tests for all of the above.
I'm haven't finished multiple "See my..." UI items. But I now have much better utils for getting
the data which will be used by that kind of UI elements
